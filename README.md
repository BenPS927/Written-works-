This is the hub for the textbooks I'm writing as part of my IT education. Link to online pdfs will be added below, section by section, as I complete them. 

I've always found I learn best by learning about something, and then writing it out - the process of drawing together various concepts in a cohesive manner, as you have to do when describing something in text, seems to effectively cement something into my brain.

This is my in progress textbook based on the content of the Comptia Network + certification. It's based off the content of Jason Dion's lectures.
The first five sections of this were written by having ai write the content and i'd transcribe it. By the sixth chapter I realised I'd learn better by writingit all myself from online lectures and youtube/google research. This change can be seen obviously in the difference in language.

This is my completed textbook based on the networking content of the Comptia A+ certification. This one is fully AI dictated, but transcribed by me, so I learned as I wrote.
