This is the hub for the textbooks I'm writing as part of my IT education. Link to online pdfs will be added below, section by section, as I complete them. 

I've always found I learn best by learning about something, and then writing it out - the process of drawing together various concepts in a cohesive manner, as you have to do when describing omething in text, seems to effectively cement something into my brain.

The first five sections of this were written by having ai write the content and i'd transcribe it. By the sixth chapter I realised I'd learn better by doing it all myself from Jason Dion's online lectures and youtube/google research. This change can be seen obviously in the difference in language.
